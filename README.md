In this example, the program prompts the user to enter three test scores, then calculates the average of those scores. 
The average score is then used to determine the student's grade using an if-else statement..

This program uses the Console.Write and Console.ReadLine methods to interact with the user, 
the double.Parse method to convert the user's input from a string to a double, 
and the if-else statement to determine the student's grade based on their average test score.

You could modify the program to include more grades or use different grading scales.
